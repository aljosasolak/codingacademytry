### Target Audience
The project is designed for:
* Sports fans who want a quick way to find upcoming events.
* Spectators looking to buy tickets and attend live events.
* Viewers who prefer to watch games online.

### About the Project
This project is part of the Sport Radar Coding Academy Challenge and showcases fundamental programming skills in creating user-friendly and practical applications. Radarcademy emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and the joy of sports.

# Features
* Task Creation and Deletion:
Easily add new sports events to the calendar or remove existing ones with just a few clicks.
* Automatic Sorting:
All events are automatically sorted by date and time in descending order, ensuring the most recent events appear at the top for quick reference.

# Technologies Used
### Programming Languages
* Java: For backend development and application logic.
* JavaScript: For enhancing interactivity on the frontend.
* MySQL: For storing and managing event data.
### Frameworks
Spring Boot: Provides the backend framework with essential dependencies, including:
* Spring Web: For handling web requests.
* MySQL Connector: For establishing the connection to the database
* Spring Boot JPA: For database interaction using Java Persistence API.
* Thymeleaf: For server-side rendering of HTML templates.
* Lombok: For reducing boilerplate code with annotations.
* Validation: For ensuring data integrity and format compliance.
* Spring Dev Tools: For streamlined development and live-reload capabilities.
### Databases
MySQL: Used as the primary database to store event information, ensuring data consistency and fast query performance.

#### Frontend Technology Consideration
While Thymeleaf was chosen for simplicity and time efficiency, a real-world application would likely use Vue.js for its flexibility and advanced features such as client-side routing, state management, and dynamic components.

#### Filtering Approach
To save development time in this project, advanced SQL queries for filtering were avoided. Instead, simpler data processing techniques were employed, prioritizing deliverability within the challenge constraints.
